# AliasManager

AliasManager keeps your dotfiles lightweight!

It finds which aliases you're not using and can be safely deleted from your dotfiles.

## Usage

Run `alias-manager` to know which aliases can be deleted from your dotfiles.

## Installing

Just like any other ruby gem: `gem install alias-manager`

## Requirements
- Your command history must be in `~/.zsh_history`
- Your aliases must be defined by sourcing `~/.zshrc`

## Upcoming features
- Indicate which alias should be added to increase productivity
